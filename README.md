# Ghotet

I’m a computer science student with a background in game design, mostly tinkering with backend development and software tools. I like building things that are modular, practical, and easy to customize.

I’m learning new languages, experimenting with local LLMs, and exploring ways to connect them to apps in a hands-on way. I also maintain a self-hosted website for web development practice.

## Focus Areas

- Backend development with Python and C# (and picking up new languages along the way)  
- Local LLM experimentation and integration with custom tools  
- Modular, flexible software that can be adapted or extended  

## Philosophy

I like building software that’s practical, open, and easy to modify. Your tools should work for you, not the other way around. I prioritize modular design and flexibility, so projects can grow or be repurposed without forcing complexity.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out via GitHub or Dev.to if you want to talk code, tools, or tinkering projects.
