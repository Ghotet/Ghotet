# Ghotet

I build tools for people who like to take control of their systems, not just rely on them.

Right now, I’m diving into automation, Windows debloating, local LLMs, and creating a self-repairing AI assistant stack. Everything I make is modular, 
offline-first, and fully in your hands — no cloud lock-ins or unnecessary fluff.

## Focus Areas

- Local LLM deployment and system integration (GPU/CPU fallback logic, prompt routing, etc)
- Portable script-based automation for Windows/Linux
- Modular AI assistants with personality files and command routing layers
- Custom toolchains for debloating, optimizing, and recovering Windows installations
- Building toward autonomous system recovery logic and zero-dependency interfaces

## Notable Repos

- [`ghost-debloat`](https://github.com/Ghotet/ghost-debloat): Clean, scriptable Windows 11 optimization tool for developers and tinkerers
- [`windows-gamer-debloat`](https://github.com/Ghotet/windows-gamer-debloat): A gamer-first variant with Xbox-safe and full-strip modes

## Philosophy

I prefer to build open tools and software that anyone can use, without worrying about money, ads, or any of that extra fluff. Your devices and the tools within them should be accessible, flexible, and in your control. Simple to use for the average user, but you have the freedom to dive in and change every little detail or repurpose it for your own use case, if you want.
