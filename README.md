# Ghotet

I build tools for people who’d rather control their systems than trust them.

I’m currently focused on automation, Windows debloat scripting, local LLMs, and building a self-repairing AI assistant stack. Everything I make is designed to be modular, offline-first, and under your control—no cloud lock-in, no marketing fluff.

## 🧭 Focus Areas

- Local LLM deployment and system integration (GPU/CPU fallback logic, prompt routing, etc)
- Portable script-based automation for Windows/Linux
- Modular AI assistants with personality files and command routing layers
- Custom toolchains for debloating, optimizing, and recovering Windows installations
- Building toward autonomous system recovery logic and zero-dependency interfaces

## 🛠 Notable Repos

- [`ghost-debloat`](https://github.com/Ghotet/ghost-debloat): Clean, scriptable Windows 11 optimization tool for developers and tinkerers
- [`windows-gamer-debloat`](https://github.com/Ghotet/windows-gamer-debloat): A gamer-first variant with Xbox-safe and full-strip modes

## 💡 Philosophy

I don’t memorize commands—I design logic flows. I work with AI the way others use a keyboard: as an extension of intent. I believe automation should be accessible, reversible, and answerable. If it breaks, it should fix itself. If it doesn’t belong, it shouldn’t be there.

## Contact

Not really the point—but if you're working on something aligned and want to talk tools, systems, or automation, reach out through GitHub.
